# Genesis Collections

The 3 genesis collections: Skvllpvnkz, Skvllgodz and Skvllpvnkz Originz play an important role as multipliers to daily staking rewards. Currently all the genesis collections are hosted as OpenSea collections, backed by their contract.

To reclaim control of our destiny we need to migrate these collections to our own smart contracts. We are planning this transition for Q1 2022 and are working on making the process as seamless as possible for our users. In effect, the OpenSea tokens will be mapped to new tokens in their respective smart contracts. Original token owners will be able to mint their respective tokens with the new contract.

More details on the role of the Genesis collections and participation rewards will be revealed in due time.
