# Lore

As many of you are aware, a Skvllpvnkz comic has been in the works and was due to be released in Q1, 2022. There have been some changes to this plan, most importantly a change of medium from a comic to animated shorts! These animations narrate the story behind the Skvllpvnkz artwork, revealing how the collections interfuse. This decision allows us to explore a variety of design and sketch techniques to tell the Skvllpvnkz story. Expect a vast world of first person perspectives told over numerous timelines. First short is just around the corner..
