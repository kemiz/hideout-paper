# Faction Expansion

We are hyped to announce a new faction within the Skvllpvnkz universe which will drop as a new collection, date TBA soon. This new faction will act as a hybrid race within the Skvllpvnkz Hideout. Whilst pitting themselves against each other in battle and ideology, they remain united against a common enemy. One side fights with deeply rooted allegiance to the ways of their Skvllpvnkz ancestors. The others stem from mutilation which turned them into something... else.

The faction will be stacked with utility to integrate with the existing Skvllpvnkz Hideout, dynamically adding to the already multi-faceted, lore-filled experience.
