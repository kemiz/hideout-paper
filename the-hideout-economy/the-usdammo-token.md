The total token allocation for the Hideout Rewards, Daycare Rewards and Mission Rewards will be distributed through Hideout staking with the maximum amount of mintable tokens set fixed at 164,250,000 $AMMO. The Hideout staking game is being offered as an entertaining and interactive way to distribute a major percentage of available $AMMO as it rolls out over the course of the next five years. Certain features of the game will allow holders to earn a guaranteed number of $AMMO per day (i.e. The Hideout & Skvllpvnkz Daycare) whereas other aspects make earnings more dynamic and variable.&#x20;

<summary><strong>Hideout Missions</strong></summary>

Within the Hideout, holders can participate in missions and quests in return for greater rewards. In these missions you can send your Skvllpvnkz out individually or in parties, to complete daily, weekly and monthly quests. Some have guaranteed rewards while others are based on an RNG system, distributed after task completion. The mission difficulty will have an effect on the reward whereby the higher the difficulty, the smaller the chance but equally, the greater the reward.
