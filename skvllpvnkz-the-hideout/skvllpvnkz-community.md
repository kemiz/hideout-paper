# Skvllpvnkz Community

Skvllpvnkz wouldn't be anywhere without the extraordinary community behind it. This paper is dedicated to all of you, as a thank you for the monumental support you have shown us along the way. We cannot wait to see what the future has in store for all of us.

It is staggering to see our community express themselves in the Skvllpvnkz image with an array of diverse and imaginative skills. The fan art coming through the channels has been downright kick-ass and we look forward to hosting our next fan-art competition. Furthermore, we now have our very own fan-fiction room setup on our Discord channel. Members can pitch story ideas and work together to bring them to fruition.
